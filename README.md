## 🔌 Wiring Diagram

### DHT11 Sensor

| DHT11 Pin | CrowPanel Pin |
|-----------|---------------|
| VCC | 3.3V |
| GND | GND |
| DATA | IO38 |

### 🌡 Temperature Alert LED

| LED | CrowPanel Pin |
|-----|---------------|
| Anode | IO43 |
| Cathode | GND |

**Wiring:** `IO43 → 220Ω → LED → GND`

*LED turns ON when temperature exceeds threshold.*

### 💧 Humidity Alert LED

| LED | CrowPanel Pin |
|-----|---------------|
| Anode | IO44 |
| Cathode | GND |

**Wiring:** `IO44 → 220Ω → LED → GND`

*LED turns ON when humidity exceeds threshold.*

## 📍 CrowPanel Pin Map Used

| Function | GPIO |
|----------|------|
| DHT11 Sensor | IO38 |
| Temperature LED | IO43 |
| Humidity LED | IO44 |
| LCD Backlight | IO2 |
| Touch SDA | IO19 |
| Touch SCL | IO20 |

## 📊 LVGL Dashboard

The interface includes:

✔ Temperature Gauge  
✔ Humidity Gauge  
✔ Temperature Trend Chart  
✔ Humidity Trend Chart  
✔ Alert Threshold Inputs  
✔ BLE Streaming Status

**Example threshold values:**

- Temperature Alert: 30°C
- Humidity Alert: 75%

*Users can change these values directly from the touchscreen.*

## 🎨 Customizing the Dashboard UI

The UI is based on the LVGL Widgets Demo.

To customize the dashboard layout, edit the file:

`lv_demo_widgets.c`

Working path used for this project:

`C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\Arduino\libraries\lvgl\src\demos\widgets`

Inside this folder you can modify:

- UI layout
- charts
- gauges
- widgets
- colors
- animations
- sensor displays

*This makes it easy to turn this project into a smart home dashboard or IoT control panel.*

## 📡 BLE Features

The ESP32 operates as a BLE device.

**Device name:** `CrowPanel-HMI`

**Tested with:** Serial Bluetooth Terminal

### 📡 BLE Commands

| Command | Function |
|---------|----------|
| ON | Turn display backlight ON |
| OFF | Turn display backlight OFF |
| READ | Start streaming sensor data |
| STOP | Stop streaming sensor data |

### 📤 BLE Data Output

When READ is sent, sensor data streams every 2 seconds.

**Example output:**

TEMP: 27.5 C

HUM: 65.0 %


## 🚨 Alert Logic

**Temperature Alert:**

if temperature >= threshold

Temperature LED ON


**Humidity Alert:**

if humidity >= threshold

Humidity LED ON


*Threshold values are adjustable from the touchscreen UI.*

## ⚡ LVGL Memory Optimization

RGB displays require large buffers.

LVGL buffers are allocated in PSRAM.

**Example buffer size used:** `800 x 80`

*This ensures stable LVGL performance on ESP32-S3.*
